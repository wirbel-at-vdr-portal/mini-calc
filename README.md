# mini-calc
a small scientific calculator, written in pascal.

## Intro
This small calculator app works text based.

Therefore, the small display window is the most important user input, you may write here without using any button.
The buttons are basically just support to remember the syntax.

You may define variables and use them in one line of text. They are active for just one text line. If you press the '=' button or use <ENTER>, the result is evaluated and printed into the very next line. Also, the last result can be pasted into text using the 'ANS' button. But remember, this is text-based. You have to check the text..
